# Portfolio Project - React+Redux - Summer Reading API

This repository is for an API source to be used with a [React + Redux front-end application](https://github.com/robert-laws/portfolio-project-july-2019-react-front-end). The API holds a database of books that are used to populate a summer reading program book list.
